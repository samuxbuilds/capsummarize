🧵 Companies are paying up to $335,000/year for “Prompt Engineers”  
(no coding required)

Most people type garbage prompts and get garbage results.  
The pros? They turn ChatGPT into a genius on demand.

Here’s exactly how they do it ⬇️

🧵 2/14:
What even IS Prompt Engineering?

It’s the art + science of writing inputs so good  
that LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini…) give you PERFECT outputs first try.

Think: Google search skills… but on steroids.  
Bad prompt = 10 tries.  
Good prompt = magic on attempt #1.

🧵 3/14:
Core concept #1 → Be stupidly specific

Bad: “Correct my paragraph”  
Good: “Act as an IELTS examiner. Correct grammar, vocabulary, coherence. Max 80 words. Suggest 2 better phrases.”

Specificity = money + time saved.

🧵 4/14:
Core concept #2 → Give it a ROLE (persona)

Telling the AI “who it is” changes everything.

Example:  
“Write a graduation poem” → generic  
“Write as Rupi Kaur’s cooler 25-year-old sister Helena, for her 18yo little sis” → suddenly it’s beautiful & personal 🔥

🧵 5/14:
Core concept #3 → Force the format

Want bullet points? Table? Checklist? JSON?  
SAY IT.

“Summarize this 2000-word essay in 7 bullets, each <10 words, then one 2-sentence conclusion.”

Don’t make the AI guess your vibe.

🧵 6/14:
Actionable tactic → Zero-shot vs Few-shot

Zero-shot: Just ask (works for things it already knows)  
Few-shot: Feed 2-3 examples first

Example:  
I told GPT-4 my favorite foods → instantly recommends perfect Dubai restaurants.  
Without examples? “I don’t know your taste.”

🧵 7/14:
Actionable tactic → Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Force step-by-step reasoning.

Add: “Think step-by-step before answering.”  
Math accuracy jumps from ~20% to 90% on hard problems.

Works for logic, business strategy, everything.

🧵 8/14:
Actionable tactic → Iterative prompting

Never accept the first answer if it’s not perfect.

Just reply:  
“Make it shorter and funnier.”  
“Add real examples.”  
“Sound more confident.”

It’s a conversation, not a vending machine.

🧵 9/14:
Common mistake #1  
Being too polite or vague

“Could you maybe help with ideas?”  
→ weak output

“You are a world-class growth marketer. Give me 10 viral tweet ideas about X. Number them. Max 25 words each.”

Boss energy = boss results.

🧵 10/14:
Common mistake #2  
Leading the answer

Don’t say: “Write a blog post saying AI will destroy jobs”  
Say: “Write a balanced 800-word post on AI’s impact on employment. Include both risks and opportunities.”

Avoids bias + hallucinations.

🧵 11/14:
Surprising fact  
AI still “hallucinates” confidently wrong answers.

Famous case: Lawyers used ChatGPT for research → cited fake cases → got sanctioned.

Always verify important stuff.  
The smoother it sounds, the more dangerous the lie can be.

🧵 12/14:
Pro tip → Tokens are money

Every word you write + every word it replies = tokens = $$$

Write once, write well.  
A 50-word perfect prompt saves hundreds of dollars over time vs 10 sloppy ones.

🧵 13/14:
Quick recap – your Prompt Engineering cheat sheet 📌

• Be specific AF  
• Assign a persona  
• Force exact format  
• Use few-shot when needed  
• Think step-by-step  
• Iterate ruthlessly  
• Never trust blindly (hallucinations!)
